# linear inequality constraints that a solution vector (x) must satisfy:
#                       G * x >= H

# Currently represent three sets of constraints on the solution vector:
#  - all solution coefficients are nonnegative
#  - the sum total of all solution coefficients is no more than 1
#  - in each of the coordinates of the target vector (estimated Bloom filter)
#    we don't overshoot by more than three standard deviations.
